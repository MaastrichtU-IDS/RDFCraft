# RDFCraft

RDFCraft is a tool for mapping csv/json data to RDF with an easy to use GUI. It
uses FastAPI for the backend, React for the frontend and everything packed in a
single executable using Nuitka.

## Features üåü

- **Easy to use GUI**: Just upload your csv/json file and start mapping your
  data to RDF.

- **Ontology Indexing**: It indexes all the classes and properties from the
  provided ontology and provides recommendations while mapping.

- **Source Indexing**: It indexes all the columns from the provided csv/json
  file and provides recommendations while mapping.

- **Auto Completion**: It provides auto completion while creating URIs for
  entities.

- **Multiple file formats**: Supports both csv and json file formats.

- **Multiple RML formats**: It generates both YARRRML and RML mappings.

## Requirements üì¶

- Latest Java Runtime Environment (JRE) or Java Development Kit (JDK) to use the
  [RMLMapper](https://github.com/RMLio/rmlmapper-java)

  - This is required to generate RML mappings.

- For MacOS, you need system version 15.0(Sequoia) or later to run the
  executable.

## Installation üöÄ

From [Releases](https://github.com/MaastrichtU-IDS/RDFCraft/releases) page,
download the latest release for your OS and extract the contents if it is
compressed. Run the executable and you are good to go.

### With Docker üê≥

Build the Docker Image:

```bash
docker build -t rdfcraft .
```

Start the container in detached mode with a custom name:

```bash
docker run --name rdfcraft -d -p 8080:8000 rdfcraft
```

This maps port **8000** inside the container to **8080** on your local machine.

After running the container, the application will be available at:
[http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

## Getting Started üö¶

You can find a detailed guide on how to use RDFCraft in the
[Guide](/docs/guide/workspaces.md) section.

## Development üõ†

### With Devcontainer üê≥

You can either use Codespaces or a local devcontainer to start developing.

For Codespaces, just open the repository in Codespaces and you are good to go.

For local devcontainer, you need to have Docker installed on your machine. Then
clone the repository and run the following command and open the repository in
VSCode. It should prompt you to open the repository in a devcontainer.

Or you can use Command Palette (Ctrl/Command+Shift+P) and search for
`Dev Container: Reopen in Container`.

### Manual Installation

1- Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:MaastrichtU-IDS/RDFCraft.git
```

2- Install the dependencies for the backend:

- If you have `just` installed:

```bash
just install-dev
```

- Otherwise:

```bash
uv sync --all-extras --dev
```

3- Install the dependencies for the frontend:

```bash
cd app
npm install
```

4- Create `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:

```bash
DEBUG=1
```

5- Start the backend

```bash
uvicorn server.server:app --reload
```

6- Start the frontend

```bash
cd app
